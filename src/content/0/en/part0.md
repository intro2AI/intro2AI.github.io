<div class="intro">

In Part 1, We will teach an AI model to learn from data. We will collect a toy dataset, train an AI on that dataset, and then study how it makes predicitons. An AI learns differently than how a Human learns. 

Pre-requisites:
You are required to have an area of interest, to which you'd like to apply AI. No complicated Math or Programming Knowledge is assumed.
